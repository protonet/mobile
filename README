== DESCRIPTION:

First of all: all of the code and documentation is work in progress, and it's redistribution or redistribution of a modified version is currently not allowed without explicit permission of the project owner (dudemeister on github), the code and documentation *will* become open source at one point (basically when it works to some degree). I have still some work to do figuring out a good license for this thing.

I hope that you will contribute to this project and have fun using and writing it as I believe this to be our chance to (each one of us) truly revolutionize the way we communicate, interact and so much more!

Protonet aims to create a new internet (let's call it internet 2.0 ;)), basically it will become a giant (actually lots and lots of connected or not connected small) mesh network(s). Most of it's nodes will run an rails frontend, this is it - and it's called 'Dashboard'. This is also it's first awesome app.

It goes hand in hand with it's low-level part (also on github, called protonet-node-setup).
 
== TECHNOLOGIES:

Protonet-Dashboard runs on rails, sqlite3, rabbitmq, eventmachine (+amqp), node.js and uses jQuery as its JS framework.


=== INSTALL

== GENERAL
git clone git@github.com:protonet/dashboard.git
mkdir -p shared/user-files
mkdir -p dashboard/public/externals/image_proxy
mkdir -p dashboard/public/externals/screenshots
cd dashboard
git submodule init
git submodule update

# if you don't have bundler install it first:
(sudo) gem install bundler

# we'll be using homebrew to manage dependencies (this is what you should use on OS X anyways)
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/raw/323731/install_homebrew.rb)"

# if you don't have imagemagick or graphicsmagick, install it first:
brew install graphicsmagick

# get your uuid stuff:
brew install ossp-uuid

# install the needed gems:
bundle install

# do the db
rake db:setup

== MESSAGING

Install our messaging broker:
brew install rabbitmq

== NODE.JS

Install node.js:
brew install node

=== START THE SYSTEM

# After installing all dependencies you can get the system running by doing these steps:
# start the messaging broker
rabbitmq-server

# and start the rails server (it will start and shutdown the js dispatcher and node.js automatically)
script/server

# goto http://localhost:3000 and enjoy the ride!

=== DEPLOYING ON TARGET SYSTEMS

To deploy on a given node:

# if this is the first time you deploy to that node you need to do this first (use the vm target for VMs that don't have wireless capabilities)
cap node deploy:first_run NODE=yournodesaddress
# and
cap node deploy:migrations NODE=yournodesaddress

# or any of our other targets
cap live deploy:migrations # -> deploys to team.protonet.info
cap xing deploy:migrations # -> deploys to protonet.xing.com
cap vm   deploy:migrations NODE=vm.address.com
cap node deploy:migrations NODE=backup.protonet.info # -> deploys to backup.protonet.info

=== DEPLOYING ON UBUNTU

bash -c "`wget -O - babushka.me/up`"
babushka sources -a dudemeister git://github.com/dudemeister/babushka-deps.git
# this is the licence key: 83489kjdfj734732snfnfdsns98jsnld
babushka "dudemeister:protonet babushka"
# now do some sourcing (to add missing paths and all that)
. ~/profile
# if you've got a full node with wifi capabilities you want to have taken over by protonet
babushka protonet:node-preparations
# otherwise use
babushka protonet:vm-preparations
# this will install all features minus wifi and networking stuff

=== OTHER STUFF
These things are not needed if you just want to do some basic development:

== RUNNNING TESTS

If you want to run our whole testsuite you'll need to add a vhost:
rabbitmqctl add_vhost /test
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /test guest ".*" ".*" ".*"

== COMPILING THE SOCKET:

TextMate -> Bundles -> ActionScript -> MTASC -> Build with MTASC

== (NOT NEEDED YET) LDAP (ON LEOPARD)

OpenLDAP is installed by default on Leopard (and earlier versions of OS X). In order to get it into a useful state, however, you will need to make a few changes:

Locate the OpenLDAP configuration files in /etc/openldap/

cp slapd.conf.default slapd.conf

Then edit your slapd.conf and change this entry:

rootpw          secret

to

rootpw          {SSHA}KT2sBUCwRfLNE6cEMfAVR3TRXxs/SDhQ

Make sure that /private/var/db/openldap/openldap-data/ exists, creating it if it does not.

Run slapd: sudo /usr/libexec/slapd
