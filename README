= PROTONET

== DESCRIPTION:

First of all: all of the code and documentation is work in progress, and it's redistribution or redistribution of a modified version is currently not allowed without explicit permission of the project owner (dudemeister on github), the code and documentation *will* become open source at one point (basically when it works to some degree). I have still some work to do figuring out a good license for this thing.

I hope that you will contribute to this project and have fun using and writing it as I believe this to be our chance to (each one of us) truly revolutionize the way we communicate, interact and so much more!

Protonet aims to create a new internet (let's call it internet 2.0 ;)), basically it's a giant mesh network. Most of it's nodes will run an merb frontend, this is it - and it's called 'Dashboard'. It goes hand in hand with it's low-level part (also on github, called protonet-base).
Together they replicate paid access point functionality, e.g. before logging in all you http request are internally redirected to this dashboard, as the idea is to allow free use of node-owner internet functionality a simple no-hassle registration (no email or identification other than an user name and password are needed) leads to full access to the internet.

== TECHNOLOGIES:

Protonet-Dashboard runs on merb, datamapper, sqlite3 and jQuery as its JS framework.

== FEATURES:

Currently you can do the following things on it:

  * Create an user account
  * Login and -out with that account data
  * Chat in the so-called Lobby
  * enjoy the awesome design ;) (I can haz graphics?) ...

== NEXT THINGS PLANNED:

  * make it look better
    ** kick ass would be good

  * see other connected users on the startpage
  * see which other users are spending time in the lobby
    ** replicate basic chat client functionality (e.g. tab completion on names and more)
  * be able to open new chat rooms
    ** make them private(hidden)/public
    ** adding/removing members to the private chats
  * initiate private chats
  * implement a way to notify node users when something new is on in the node and specifically in chats (e.g. you got a private message or similar things)
  * allow editing of your profile
    ** adding of a profile pic
    ** adding your twitter account
  * add possibility to create public/private lists
  * add possibility to upload files
  * add possibility to attach uploaded files to a list

== MAKING IT RUN:

To run it you need to do following things (sudo if needed):

# gem install merb --include-dependencies
# gem install dm-validations
# gem install merb_helpers
# gem install merb_datamapper
# gem install do_sqlite3

Go to your dashboard directory and run merb, you should be able to point your browser to http://localhost:4000 and see the protonet dashboard.
TODO aj: remove dbfiles from repo and add text for db creation/migration
