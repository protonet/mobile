== DESCRIPTION:

First of all: all of the code and documentation is work in progress, and it's redistribution or redistribution of a modified version is currently not allowed without explicit permission of the project owner (dudemeister on github), the code and documentation *will* become open source at one point (basically when it works to some degree). I have still some work to do figuring out a good license for this thing.

I hope that you will contribute to this project and have fun using and writing it as I believe this to be our chance to (each one of us) truly revolutionize the way we communicate, interact and so much more!

Protonet aims to create a new internet (let's call it internet 2.0 ;)), basically it will become a giant (actually lots and lots of connected or not connected small) mesh network(s). Most of it's nodes will run an rails frontend, this is it - and it's called 'Dashboard'. This is also it's first awesome app.

It goes hand in hand with it's low-level part (also on github, called protonet-node-setup).
 
== TECHNOLOGIES:

Protonet-Dashboard runs on rails, sqlite3, rabbitmq, eventmachine (+amqp), node.js and uses jQuery as its JS framework.


=== INSTALL

== GENERAL
git clone git@github.com:protonet/dashboard.git
cd dashboard
git submodule init
git submodule update

# if you don't have bundler install it first:
(sudo) gem install bundler

# if you don't have imagemagick install it first:
(sudo) port install imagemagick

# install the needed gems:
bundle install

# do the db
rake db:setup

== MESSAGING

Install our messaging broker:

sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install rabbitmq-server

If you want to run our whole testsuite:
sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost /test
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /test guest ".*" ".*" ".*"

== NODE.JS

Install node.js by downloading it from http://nodejs.org/#download (>= 0.1.100)
then extract it and execute:

./configure
make
(sudo) make install

=== START THE SYSTEM

# After installing all dependencies you can get the system running by doing these steps:
# start the messaging broker
sudo rabbitmq-server

# and start the rails server (it will start and shutdown the js dispatcher and node.js automatically)
script/server

# goto http://localhost:3000 and enjoy the ride!

=== DEPLOYING ON TARGET SYSTEMS

To deploy on a given node:

# if this is the first time you deploy to that node you need to do this first (use the vm target for VMs that don't have wireless capabilities)
cap node deploy:first_run NODE=yournodesaddress
# and
cap node deploy:migrations NODE=yournodesaddress

# or any of our other targets
cap live deploy:migrations # -> deploys to team.protonet.info
cap xing deploy:migrations # -> deploys to protonet.xing.com
cap vm   deploy:migrations NODE=vm.address.com
cap node deploy:migrations NODE=backup.protonet.info # -> deploys to backup.protonet.info

=== OTHER STUFF
These things are not needed if you just want to do some basic development:

== LOCAL APACHE CONFIG
setup apache for local development:

sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
sudo mate /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
sudo mate /etc/apache2/other/protonet.conf
sudo apachectl graceful
mate /etc/hosts
tail -f log/development
touch tmp/restart.txt

# /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
LoadModule passenger_module /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.5/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   PassengerRoot /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.5
   PassengerRuby /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby

# /etc/apache2/other/protonet.conf
NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName protonet.local
  DocumentRoot "/Users/jelveh/Projekte/protonet-dashboard/public"
  RailsEnv development
  RailsAllowModRewrite off
  <directory "/Users/jelveh/Projekte/protonet-dashboard/public">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </directory>
</VirtualHost>


# /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 protonet.local

ATTN: change your apache user to the same user passenger is running in - FIXME!

http://railscasts.com/episodes/122-passenger-in-development

ATTENTION: you might need to install some other dependecies.

== COMPILING THE SOCKET:

TextMate -> Bundles -> ActionScript -> MTASC -> Build with MTASC

== FLASH SOCKET COMMUNICATION CAVEATS

Awesome stuff is about to happen... since we are now using rabbitmq we need a way to send the correct policy to the requesting flash socket. this will be done by a very simple eventmachine server listening to the default policy communication port.

Starting the js dispatching server:
messaging/event_machine/js_dispatching_server.rb

== LDAP (ON LEOPARD)

OpenLDAP is installed by default on Leopard (and earlier versions of OS X). In order to get it into a useful state, however, you will need to make a few changes:

Locate the OpenLDAP configuration files in /etc/openldap/

cp slapd.conf.default slapd.conf

Then edit your slapd.conf and change this entry:

rootpw          secret

to

rootpw          {SSHA}KT2sBUCwRfLNE6cEMfAVR3TRXxs/SDhQ

Make sure that /private/var/db/openldap/openldap-data/ exists, creating it if it does not.

Run slapd: sudo /usr/libexec/slapd
